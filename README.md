HTML Task - Develop a hobby website that demonstrates your understanding of the use of HTML5 to write web pages

Take the designs/ideas you produced for a hobby/enthusiast website in Sprint 1 and produce an
HTML5 version of the site. Do not use CSS just HTML, and build the site using HTML code i.e.
avoid prebuild templates such as used by Wix etc.

The site should contain as a minimum:

• A Home Page containing general info about the club etc. with in-page links to other parts of the site

• A News Page containing articles

• An Activity Page with a list of club activities

• A Club Shop Page with a table of items for sales

• A Sign-up Page for the club

• A consistent navigation menu across all pages

• An aside for tertiary content such as advertising
